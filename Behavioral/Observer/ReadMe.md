# Observer pattern: notification or subcription example

notifies multiple objects or subscribers, about any event that happen to the object they're observing, or publisher.
(Sales promotion notifications for a retail store)

lets new subscribers join and current subscribers leave. When an event happens, publisher goes over subscribers and calls method declared in the interface.

allows us to take action on a set of objects when and if the stae of another object changes.
